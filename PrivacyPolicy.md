# Privacy Policy ‚Äì JUST Extension

**Effective Date:** 2025/May/13

JUST Extension is a Chrome browser extension developed to enhance the online experience of students at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## 1. Information We Collect
JUST Extension is designed to operate locally within your browser. We do **not collect**, **store**, or **transmit** any personally identifiable information (PII) to any external server.

The extension may use the following browser permissions:

- **`storage`**: We use Chrome‚Äôs local storage API to save your preferences (e.g., dark mode settings, GPA calculator inputs, and quick links). This data stays on your device and is never shared.
- **`notifications`**: We use notifications to inform you when certain actions are complete (e.g., grade calculation, evaluation submission). These are local browser notifications and do not require or transmit any user data externally.

## 2. Use of Permissions
We only request permissions that are essential for the intended functionality of the extension:

- `storage`: To remember your settings and streamline your experience.
- `notifications`: To alert you when data like GPA results or registration information is ready.

We **do not** access or transmit your personal data from university websites or portals.

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
JUST Extension does **not** share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. All functionality is handled locally within your browser.

## 4. Security
We use Chrome's built-in extension framework, which ensures that your data is safely stored within your browser. No external databases or servers are involved.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised "Effective Date."
